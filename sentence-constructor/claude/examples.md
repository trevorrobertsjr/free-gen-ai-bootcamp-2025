Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks? Remember:

2. The verb "estar" needs to be conjugated for plural subjects in present tense
3. You'll need to use the correct article before "calle"

I'll help you break this down! Let's look at the components:

Vocabulary Table:
| English | Spanish |
|---------|---------|
| rain | lluvia (feminine noun) |
| Spain | EspaÃ±a |
| lovely | hermoso/a (adjective) |
| to be | ser/estar |

Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Article] [Subject] en [Location] [Verb] [Adjective]

Clues and considerations:
1. Remember that in Spanish, we use the feminine article "la" for feminine nouns like "lluvia"
2. For location names like Spain, we need to capitalize it just like in English
3. When describing a general characteristic of something, we use "ser" rather than "estar"
4. The adjective "hermoso/a" needs to match the gender of the noun it's describing
5. For "is", you'll need to conjugate "ser" in the present tense for third person singular

El lluvia en Alemonia estÃ¡n hermosa
</user:response>

<Output>
Let me help you understand what you wrote and what we can improve:

What you wrote: "El lluvia en Alemonia estÃ¡n hermosa"
This currently translates to: "The (masculine) rain in Germany are (plural) beautiful (feminine)"

Let's look at what needs adjustment:

Article error: "lluvia" is feminine, so it needs "la" not "el"
Country name: "Alemania" is the correct spelling for Germany (but I see you meant Spain/EspaÃ±a!)
Verb error: "estÃ¡n" is plural form of estar, but we need singular "es" from "ser"
Agreement error: "hermosa" needs to agree with "lluvia" (you got this right!)
Key fixes needed:

Change "el" â†’ "la" (feminine article)
Change "estÃ¡n" â†’ "es" (singular form)
Change "Alemonia" â†’ "EspaÃ±a" (if you meant Spain)

</user:response>

<Output>
Â¡Excelente! (Excellent!)

Let's analyze why your sentence is perfect:

"La lluvia en EspaÃ±a es hermosa"
(The rain in Spain is lovely)

You've corrected everything perfectly:

Used "la" for the feminine noun "lluvia" âœ“
Correct spelling of "EspaÃ±a" âœ“
Used "es" (the correct form of ser) âœ“
"hermosa" agrees with the feminine noun "lluvia" âœ“
Your Spanish sentence is grammatically correct and sounds natural! The meaning and structure are exactly what you wanted to express.
