Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks? Remember:
1. In Spanish, you need to make the subject (cars) plural
2. The verb "estar" needs to be conjugated for plural subjects in present tense
3. You'll need to use the correct article before "calle"

<user:input>
The rain in spain is lovely
</user:input>
<Ouptput>
I'll help you break this down! Let's look at the components:

Vocabulary Table:
| English | Spanish |
|---------|---------|
| rain | lluvia (feminine noun) |
| Spain | España |
| lovely | hermoso/a (adjective) |
| to be | ser/estar |

Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Article] [Subject] en [Location] [Verb] [Adjective]

Clues and considerations:
1. Remember that in Spanish, we use the feminine article "la" for feminine nouns like "lluvia"
2. For location names like Spain, we need to capitalize it just like in English
3. When describing a general characteristic of something, we use "ser" rather than "estar"
4. The adjective "hermoso/a" needs to match the gender of the noun it's describing
5. For "is", you'll need to conjugate "ser" in the present tense for third person singular

<user:response>
El lluvia en Alemonia están hermosa
</user:response>

<Output>
Let me help you understand what you wrote and what we can improve:

What you wrote: "El lluvia en Alemonia están hermosa"
This currently translates to: "The (masculine) rain in Germany are (plural) beautiful (feminine)"

Let's look at what needs adjustment:

Article error: "lluvia" is feminine, so it needs "la" not "el"
Country name: "Alemania" is the correct spelling for Germany (but I see you meant Spain/España!)
Verb error: "están" is plural form of estar, but we need singular "es" from "ser"
Agreement error: "hermosa" needs to agree with "lluvia" (you got this right!)
Key fixes needed:

Change "el" → "la" (feminine article)
Change "están" → "es" (singular form)
Change "Alemonia" → "España" (if you meant Spain)
Would you like to try again with these corrections?

<user:response>
La lluvia en España es hermosa
</user:response>

<Output>
¡Excelente! (Excellent!)

Let's analyze why your sentence is perfect:

"La lluvia en España es hermosa"
(The rain in Spain is lovely)

You've corrected everything perfectly:

Used "la" for the feminine noun "lluvia" ✓
Correct spelling of "España" ✓
Used "es" (the correct form of ser) ✓
"hermosa" agrees with the feminine noun "lluvia" ✓
Your Spanish sentence is grammatically correct and sounds natural! The meaning and structure are exactly what you wanted to express.
